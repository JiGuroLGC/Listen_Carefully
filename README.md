# Listen_Carefully

## What is Listen_Carefully ?

Listen_Carefully is an offline and free white noise player , help people fall asleep quickly , but it currently only supports Chinese .

## Why should we develop Listen_Carefully ?

I used to be an insomniac, and I often couldn't fall asleep until three or four in the morning. After going to the hospital for a checkup, the doctor said I was too stressed and couldn't sleep. 

One day, after a friend recommended it, I learned about white noise. I still remember how happy I was the first time I listened to white noise and dreamed sweetly. Although today's mobile phones generally have built-in white noise functions, I think the sound resources are not rich enough, and third-party white noise software either requires payment or is connected to the Internet, and the degree of freedom is not high. 

Until one day, I discovered a website where I heard the best white noise I have ever heard. After using it a few times, I found it inconvenient, so I suddenly thought: Is it possible to use this website through After some transformation and optimization, I made it a white noise APP that is completely free and offline run? 

Just do it, my friends and I made an APP called Listen_Carefully. The reason why we named it Listen_Carefully is because we hope that when you use this software, you can "listen to the light and have peace of mind", just as the welcome message says. After many iterations, the first version of Listen_Carefully was born.


Listen_Carefully has exquisite animations and ultimate sound effects, which are directly packaged and optimized by web engineering. In theory it works for most users, but please make sure your WebView version is not too low. Because the web page is directly packaged into the installation package, this software can run completely offline without being interfered by any network factors and guarantee you a quiet and smooth sleep.

Listen_Carefully can emit sounds from various natural or cultural environments, such as rain, thunder, night, farm, forest, fallen leaves...etc. You can adjust the volume of each sound at will and They mix together to create your own white noise. It also has a timer function that automatically turns off after you fall asleep.

All in all, If you have any suggestions for improvement, please put them forward directly and we will continue to work hard. Thank you for your cooperation!

## 什么是 聆 · 音 ？

聆 · 音 是一款离线且免费的白噪音播放器，帮助人们快速入睡，但是目前只支持中文。

## 我们为什么要开发 聆 · 音 ？

我以前是一个失眠症患者，经常到了凌晨三四点都睡不着觉。去医院检查后，医生说我的压力过大，所以无法入睡。

有一天经过朋友的推荐，我知道了白噪音这种东西，我至今还记得我第一次听着白噪音甜蜜地做梦的时候有多么快乐。虽然现在的手机普遍都自带白噪音功能，但是我认为声音资源不够丰富，而第三方的白噪音软件不是要付费，就是要联网，自由程度不高。

直到有一天，我发现了一个网站，我在那个网站里听到了我至今听过最好的白噪音，我用了几次之后发现不太方便，于是我突发奇想:是否能将这个网站经过我的一番改造和优化，做成一个完全离线且免费的白噪音APP？

说干就干，我和朋友们一起做出了一款名叫 聆 · 音 的APP，之所以我们把它取名为 聆 · 音 ，是因为我们希望各位在用这款软件的时候，能够"聆听光芒，音神安详"，正如欢迎语说的那样。在经过多次迭代之后，聆 · 音 的第一个版本就诞生了。

聆 · 音 有着精致的动画和极致的音效，直接由网页工程打包优化而成。理论上适用于大多数用户，但是请确保您的WebView版本不要过低。因为直接把网页打包进了安装包，所以此软件可以完全离线运行，不受任何网络因素的干扰，
保证您安静畅通的入睡。

聆 · 音 可以发出各种自然或人文环境的声音，比如雨声、雷声、夜晚、农场、森林、落叶......等等等等，您可以随意的调整每种声音的音量，并把它们混合在一起，形成您独属的白噪音。它还有定时功能，可以在您入睡之后自动关闭。

总而言之，如果您有什么改进意见，请您直接提出来，我们会继续加油，感谢大家！
