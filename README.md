## Introduce

**Listen_Carefully** is an offline and free white noise player , help people fall asleep quickly , but it currently only supports a few languages .

## Interface Preview

If you want to conveniently and quickly preview the interface of **Listen_Carefully** , please visit the following website : https://jigurolgc.github.io/Listen_Carefully

##  Development Background

I used to be an insomniac , and I often couldn't fall asleep until three or four in the morning . After going to the hospital for a checkup , the doctor said I was too stressed and couldn't sleep . 

One day , after a friend recommended it , I learned about white noise . I still remember how happy I was the first time I listened to white noise and dreamed sweetly . Although today's mobile phones generally have built-in white noise functions , I think the sound resources are not rich enough , and third-party white noise software either requires payment or is connected to the Internet , and the degree of freedom is not high . 

Until one day , I discovered a website where I heard the best white noise I have ever heard . After using it a few times , I found it inconvenient , so I suddenly thought : Is it possible to use this website through After some transformation and optimization , I made it a white noise APP that is completely free and offline run ? 

Just do it , my friends and I made an APP called **Listen_Carefully** . The reason why we named it **Listen_Carefully** is because we hope that when you use this software, you can " Listen To The Light And Have Peace Of Mind " , just as the welcome message says . After many iterations , the first version of **Listen_Carefully** was born .

## Miscellaneous Questions

1. Q : Why **Listen_Carefully** Not working properly on my device ?  
   A  : **Listen_Carefully** Directly packaged and optimized by the web project , it is theoretically suitable for most users , but please make sure that your WebView and Android version are not too low or too high . If you have confirmed these conditions , **Listen_Carefully** still does not work properly on your device , it may be **Listen_Carefully** has not yet adapted to your device or CPU architecture , please submit your comments to us , and wait patiently for the next version of the optimization and upgrade .

2. Q : Why **Listen_Carefully** is still relatively small ?  
   A  : Because we have just started development **Listen_Carefully** , and due to our work , we can only squeeze out free time on the weekend to write code . But for the known white noise software on the market and for the actual needs in daily life , these features are completely sufficient .

3. Q : I am a special area user , what should I do if I have access problems ?  
   A  : It doesn't matter , we have prepared an alternate download link for you , and we guarantee that the software downloaded by the alternate link is exactly the same as the distro . And we also have our repositories in open source communities such as Gitee , so you can move to other open source communities to download .
