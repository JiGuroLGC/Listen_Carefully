## What is Listen_Carefully ?

Listen_Carefully is an offline and free white noise player , help people fall asleep quickly , but it currently only supports Chinese .

## Why should we develop Listen_Carefully ?

I used to be an insomniac, and I often couldn't fall asleep until three or four in the morning. After going to the hospital for a checkup, the doctor said I was too stressed and couldn't sleep. 

One day, after a friend recommended it, I learned about white noise. I still remember how happy I was the first time I listened to white noise and dreamed sweetly. Although today's mobile phones generally have built-in white noise functions, I think the sound resources are not rich enough, and third-party white noise software either requires payment or is connected to the Internet, and the degree of freedom is not high. Until one day, I discovered a website where I heard the best white noise I have ever heard.

After using it a few times, I found it inconvenient, so I suddenly thought: Is it possible to use this website through After some transformation and optimization, I made it a white noise APP that is completely free before going offline? Just do it, my friends and I made an APP called Listen_Carefully. After many iterations, the first version of Listen_Carefully was born.


Listen_Carefully has exquisite animations and ultimate sound effects, which are directly packaged and optimized by web engineering. In theory it works for most users, but please make sure your WebView version is not too low. Because the web page is directly packaged into the installation package, this software can run completely offline without being interfered by any network factors and guarantee you a quiet and smooth sleep.

Listen_Carefully can emit sounds from various natural or cultural environments, such as rain, thunder, night, farm, forest, fallen leaves...etc. You can adjust the volume of each sound at will and They mix together to create your own white noise. It also has a timer function that automatically turns off after you fall asleep.

All in all, ,  If you have any suggestions for improvement, please put them forward directly and we will continue to work hard. Thank you for your cooperation!
