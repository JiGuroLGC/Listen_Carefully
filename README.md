## What is Listen_Carefully ?

Listen_Carefully is an offline and free white noise player , help people fall asleep quickly , but it currently only supports Chinese .

## Why should we develop Listen_Carefully ?

I used to be an insomniac , and I often couldn't fall asleep until three or four in the morning . After going to the hospital for a checkup , the doctor said I was too stressed and couldn't sleep . 

One day , after a friend recommended it , I learned about white noise . I still remember how happy I was the first time I listened to white noise and dreamed sweetly . Although today's mobile phones generally have built-in white noise functions , I think the sound resources are not rich enough , and third-party white noise software either requires payment or is connected to the Internet , and the degree of freedom is not high . 

Until one day , I discovered a website where I heard the best white noise I have ever heard . After using it a few times , I found it inconvenient , so I suddenly thought : Is it possible to use this website through After some transformation and optimization , I made it a white noise APP that is completely free and offline run ? 

Just do it , my friends and I made an APP called Listen_Carefully . The reason why we named it Listen_Carefully is because we hope that when you use this software, you can " listen to the light and have peace of mind " , just as the welcome message says . After many iterations , the first version of Listen_Carefully was born .

## Why doesn't Listen_Carefully work properly on my device ?

Listen_Carefully is directly packaged and optimized by web engineering . It is theoretically suitable for most users , but please make sure that your WebView and Android versions are not too low or too high . If after confirming these conditions , Listen_Carefully still cannot run normally on your device , it may be that Listen_Carefully has not adapted to your device or CPU architecture . Please submit your comments to us and wait patiently for the next one version optimization and upgrade .

## What are the functions and features of Listen_Carefully ?

Listen_Carefully has exquisite animations and ultimate sound effects . Because the web page is directly packaged into the installation package , this software can run completely offline without being disturbed by any network factors , ensuring that you can sleep quietly and smoothly .

Listen_Carefully can emit sounds from various natural or cultural environments , such as rain , thunder , night , farm , forest , fallen leaves . . . etc. You can adjust the volume of each sound at will . And mix them together to create your own white noise . It also has a timer function that automatically turns off after you fall asleep .

## Our outlook and summary for the future ?

We hope to become an excellent development team and continue to produce excellent works for everyone . If you have any suggestions for improvement , please put them forward directly and we will continue to work hard . Let us work tirelessly and forge ahead on the road to pursuing our dreams ! Thank you all for your help and support !
