## Introduce

**Listen_Carefully** is an offline and free white noise player , help people fall asleep quickly , but it currently only supports Chinese .

##  Development Background

I used to be an insomniac , and I often couldn't fall asleep until three or four in the morning . After going to the hospital for a checkup , the doctor said I was too stressed and couldn't sleep . 

One day , after a friend recommended it , I learned about white noise . I still remember how happy I was the first time I listened to white noise and dreamed sweetly . Although today's mobile phones generally have built-in white noise functions , I think the sound resources are not rich enough , and third-party white noise software either requires payment or is connected to the Internet , and the degree of freedom is not high . 

Until one day , I discovered a website where I heard the best white noise I have ever heard . After using it a few times , I found it inconvenient , so I suddenly thought : Is it possible to use this website through After some transformation and optimization , I made it a white noise APP that is completely free and offline run ? 

Just do it , my friends and I made an APP called **Listen_Carefully** . The reason why we named it **Listen_Carefully** is because we hope that when you use this software, you can " listen to the light and have peace of mind " , just as the welcome message says . After many iterations , the first version of **Listen_Carefully** was born .
