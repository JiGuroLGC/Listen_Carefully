# Introduce Listen_Carefully

Listen_Carefully has exquisite animations and ultimate sound effects, which are directly packaged and optimized by web engineering. In theory it works for most users, but please make sure your WebView version is not too low. Because the web page is directly packaged into the installation package, this software can run completely offline without being interfered by any network factors and guarantee you a quiet and smooth sleep.

Listen_Carefully can emit sounds from various natural or cultural environments, such as rain, thunder, night, farm, forest, fallen leaves...etc. You can adjust the volume of each sound at will and They mix together to create your own white noise. It also has a timer function that automatically turns off after you fall asleep.

All in all, Listen_Carefully is an offline and free white noise player, but it currently only supports Chinese. If you have any suggestions for improvement, please put them forward directly and we will continue to work hard. Thank you for your cooperation!
